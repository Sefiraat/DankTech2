DankTech2 is a full, Slimefun Only, rewrite of my previous plugin DankTech. DankTech was itself an attempt to recreate the [Dank Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dank-storage) mod, [/dank/null](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dank-null) and OpenBlocks /dev/null in the form of a plugin.

## Features
The plugin currently features:
* 9 tiers of Dank Packs. Each Tier has additional slots available inside it and each slot, in turn, has more space for items.
* 9 tiers of Trash Packs which has far more slots, but doesn't store any items, it just voids them all!
* Picked up items are automatically filtered into the correct slot of the correct dank/trash pack.
* Voiding for any items over the slot's limit so you dont get weighed down.
* Withdrawl of items 1, by stack, by a full inventory
* Input of all matching items in inventory
* A nifty cargo-compatible unloader
* Using blocks inside dank to build

## Credits
A big shout out to the owners of [mct.tantrum.org](https://mct.enjin.com/) who let me test on their server even once it was clear I barely knew what I was doing for DankTech and then again when I slightly knew what I was doing with DankTech2! <3

Another big shoutout to **GentlemanCheesy** of **mc.talosmp.net** for being my first (and as of writing this, only!) sponsor. A few coffee's a month to make me feel better about making these addons <3
